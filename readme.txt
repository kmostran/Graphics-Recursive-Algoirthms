To compile the program type: make

Then to run the boilerplate

Keys 1, 2 and 3 cycle between the scenes, with repteated hits of the same key doing more iterations of that scene. After the max iteration count has been reached, hitting the scene's key again starts the scene over again from scene 1. Also, transferring between scenes does not overwrite the counter of any other scene.I didn't have the time to complete the bonus.
